- **Background Noise Reduction**: Built-in signal processing reduces API costs
- **Adaptive Confidence Scoring**: Dynamic thresholds based on environment conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key is required"**
- Enter a valid API key in Smart Transcriber settings
- Use the "Verify" button to test your API key
- Ensure your OpenAI account has available credits

**"Failed to initialize: Permission denied"**
- Grant microphone permission when prompted by your browser
- Check system privacy settings (macOS: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone)
- Restart Obsidian if permissions were recently changed

**"Voice not detected" or "No transcription"**
- Check if your microphone is working in other applications
- Adjust the audio level - speak louder or move closer to microphone
- Try adjusting the "Pause Detection Threshold" in settings
- Ensure background noise isn't too high

**"Transcription failed" or API errors**
- Verify your internet connection is stable
- Check that your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Try reducing the segment duration if uploads are timing out
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Performance Tips

- **Microphone Quality**: Use a good quality microphone positioned 6-12 inches from your mouth
- **Speaking Style**: Speak clearly at a moderate pace with natural pauses
- **Environment**: Record in a quiet environment to improve voice detection accuracy
- **Settings Optimization**: 
  - Start with default settings (8s segments, 1s pause threshold)
  - Adjust pause threshold based on your speaking rhythm (faster speakers: 500ms, slower: 2000ms)
  - Set minimum segment duration to 3-5s to avoid processing very short utterances
- **API Efficiency**: The smart voice detection significantly reduces API costs by only processing segments with actual speech

## Privacy & Security

- **Audio Processing**: Audio is only sent to OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription
- **No Local Storage**: Audio segments are processed in memory and not stored on disk
- **Smart Filtering**: Voice detection prevents accidental recording of system audio or background noise
- **Secure API**: API key is stored locally in Obsidian settings, never transmitted to third parties
- **Local Transcripts**: All transcription results are stored locally in your Obsidian vault
- **No Tracking**: The plugin does not collect analytics or usage data
